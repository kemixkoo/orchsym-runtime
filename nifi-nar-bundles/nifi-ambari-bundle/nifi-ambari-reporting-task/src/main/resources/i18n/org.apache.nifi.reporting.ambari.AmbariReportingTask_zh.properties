__CapabilityDescription=Publishes metrics from NiFi to Ambari Metrics Service (AMS). Due to how the Ambari Metrics Service works, this reporting task should be scheduled to run every 60 seconds. Each iteration it will send the metrics from the previous iteration, and calculate the current metrics to be sent on next iteration. Scheduling this reporting task at a frequency other than 60 seconds may produce unexpected results.
