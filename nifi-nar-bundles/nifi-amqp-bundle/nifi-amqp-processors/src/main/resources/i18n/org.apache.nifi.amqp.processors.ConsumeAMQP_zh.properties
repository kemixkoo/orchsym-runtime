__CapabilityDescription=Consumes AMQP Messages from an AMQP Broker using the AMQP 0.9.1 protocol. Each message that is received from the AMQP Broker will be emitted as its own FlowFile to the 'success' relationship.
__Tags=amqp, rabbit, get, message, receive, consume
Queue.displayName=Queue
Queue.description=The name of the existing AMQP Queue from which messages will be consumed. Usually pre-defined by AMQP administrator. 
auto.acknowledge.displayName=Auto-Acknowledge messages
auto.acknowledge.description=If true, messages that are received will be auto-acknowledged by the AMQP Broker. This generally will provide better throughput but could result in messages being lost upon restart of NiFi
__AllowableValue.auto.acknowledge.false.displayName=false
__AllowableValue.auto.acknowledge.true.displayName=true
batch.size.displayName=Batch Size
batch.size.description=The maximum number of messages that should be pulled in a single session. Once this many messages have been received (or once no more messages are readily available), the messages received will be transferred to the 'success' relationship and the messages will be acknowledged with the AMQP Broker. Setting this value to a larger number could result in better performance, particularly for very small messages, but can also result in more messages being duplicated upon sudden restart of NiFi.
Host_Name.displayName=Host Name
Host_Name.description=Network address of AMQP broker (e.g., localhost)
Port.displayName=Port
Port.description=Numeric value identifying Port of AMQP broker (e.g., 5671)
