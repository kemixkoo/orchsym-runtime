__CapabilityDescription=Creates an AMQP Message from the contents of a FlowFile and sends the message to an AMQP Exchange. In a typical AMQP exchange model, the message that is sent to the AMQP Exchange will be routed based on the 'Routing Key' to its final destination in the queue (the binding). If due to some misconfiguration the binding between the Exchange, Routing Key and Queue is not set up, the message will have no final destination and will return (i.e., the data will not make it to the queue). If that happens you will see a log in both app-log and bulletin stating to that effect, and the FlowFile will be routed to the 'failure' relationship.

Exchange_Name.displayName=Exchange Name
Exchange_Name.description=The name of the AMQP Exchange the messages will be sent to. Usually provided by the AMQP administrator (e.g., 'amq.direct'). It is an optional property. If kept empty the messages will be sent to a default AMQP exchange.
Routing_Key.displayName=Routing Key
Routing_Key.description=The name of the Routing Key that will be used by AMQP to route messages from the exchange to a destination queue(s). Usually provided by the administrator (e.g., 'myKey')In the event when messages are sent to a default exchange this property corresponds to a destination queue name, otherwise a binding from the Exchange to a Queue via Routing Key must be set (usually by the AMQP administrator)
