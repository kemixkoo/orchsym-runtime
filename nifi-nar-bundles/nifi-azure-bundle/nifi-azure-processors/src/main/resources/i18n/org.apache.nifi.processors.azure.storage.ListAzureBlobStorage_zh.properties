__CapabilityDescription=Lists blobs in an Azure Storage container. Listing details are attached to an empty FlowFile for use with FetchAzureBlobStorage.  This Processor is designed to run on Primary Node only in a cluster. If the primary node changes, the new Primary Node will pick up where the previous node left off without duplicating all of the data.

container-name.displayName=Container Name
container-name.description=Name of the Azure storage container
storage-sas-token.displayName=SAS Token
storage-sas-token.description=Shared Access Signature token, including the leading '?'. Specify either SAS Token (recommended) or Account Key. There are certain risks in allowing the SAS token to be stored as a flowfile attribute. While it does provide for a more flexible flow by allowing the account name to be fetched dynamically from a flowfile attribute, care must be taken to restrict access to the event provenance data (e.g. by strictly controlling the policies governing provenance for this Processor). In addition, the provenance repositories may be put on encrypted disk partitions.
storage-account-name.displayName=Storage Account Name
storage-account-name.description=The storage account name.  There are certain risks in allowing the account name to be stored as a flowfile attribute. While it does provide for a more flexible flow by allowing the account name to be fetched dynamically from a flowfile attribute, care must be taken to restrict access to the event provenance data (e.g. by strictly controlling the policies governing provenance for this Processor). In addition, the provenance repositories may be put on encrypted disk partitions.
storage-account-key.displayName=Storage Account Key
storage-account-key.description=The storage account key. This is an admin-like password providing access to every container in this account. It is recommended one uses Shared Access Signature (SAS) token instead for fine-grained control with policies. There are certain risks in allowing the account key to be stored as a flowfile attribute. While it does provide for a more flexible flow by allowing the account key to be fetched dynamically from a flow file attribute, care must be taken to restrict access to the event provenance data (e.g. by strictly controlling the policies governing provenance for this Processor).

proxy-configuration-service.description=Specifies the Proxy Configuration Controller Service to proxy network requests. Supported proxies\: HTTP, SOCKS

__WritesAttribute.azure.container.description=The name of the Azure container
__WritesAttribute.azure.blobname.description=The name of the Azure blob
__WritesAttribute.azure.primaryUri.description=Primary location for blob content
__WritesAttribute.azure.secondaryUri.description=Secondary location for blob content
__WritesAttribute.azure.etag.description=Etag for the Azure blob
__WritesAttribute.azure.length.description=Length of the blob
__WritesAttribute.azure.timestamp.description=The timestamp in Azure for the blob
__WritesAttribute.mime.type.description=MimeType of the content
__WritesAttribute.lang.description=Language code for the content
__WritesAttribute.azure.blobtype.description=This is the type of blob and can be either page or block type
__Stateful.description=After performing a listing of blobs, the timestamp of the newest blob is stored. This allows the Processor to list only blobs that have been added or modified after this date the next time that the Processor is run.  State is stored across the cluster so that this Processor can be run on Primary Node only and if a new Primary Node is selected, the new node can pick up where the previous node left off, without duplicating the data.
