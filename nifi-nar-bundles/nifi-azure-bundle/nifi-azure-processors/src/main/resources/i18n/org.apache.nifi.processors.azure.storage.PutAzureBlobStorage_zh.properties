__Tags=azure, microsoft, cloud, storage, blob
container-name.displayName=Container Name
container-name.description=Name of the Azure storage container
storage-sas-token.displayName=SAS Token
storage-sas-token.description=Shared Access Signature token, including the leading '?'. Specify either SAS Token (recommended) or Account Key. There are certain risks in allowing the SAS token to be stored as a flowfile attribute. While it does provide for a more flexible flow by allowing the account name to be fetched dynamically from a flowfile attribute, care must be taken to restrict access to the event provenance data (e.g. by strictly controlling the policies governing provenance for this Processor). In addition, the provenance repositories may be put on encrypted disk partitions.
storage-account-name.displayName=Storage Account Name
storage-account-name.description=The storage account name.  There are certain risks in allowing the account name to be stored as a flowfile attribute. While it does provide for a more flexible flow by allowing the account name to be fetched dynamically from a flowfile attribute, care must be taken to restrict access to the event provenance data (e.g. by strictly controlling the policies governing provenance for this Processor). In addition, the provenance repositories may be put on encrypted disk partitions.
storage-account-key.displayName=Storage Account Key
storage-account-key.description=The storage account key. This is an admin-like password providing access to every container in this account. It is recommended one uses Shared Access Signature (SAS) token instead for fine-grained control with policies. There are certain risks in allowing the account key to be stored as a flowfile attribute. While it does provide for a more flexible flow by allowing the account key to be fetched dynamically from a flow file attribute, care must be taken to restrict access to the event provenance data (e.g. by strictly controlling the policies governing provenance for this Processor).
