__Tags=azure, microsoft, cloud, storage, queue, enqueue
storage-account-name.displayName=Storage Account Name
storage-account-name.description=The storage account name.  There are certain risks in allowing the account name to be stored as a flowfile attribute. While it does provide for a more flexible flow by allowing the account name to be fetched dynamically from a flowfile attribute, care must be taken to restrict access to the event provenance data (e.g. by strictly controlling the policies governing provenance for this Processor). In addition, the provenance repositories may be put on encrypted disk partitions.
storage-account-key.displayName=Storage Account Key
storage-account-key.description=The storage account key. This is an admin-like password providing access to every container in this account. It is recommended one uses Shared Access Signature (SAS) token instead for fine-grained control with policies. There are certain risks in allowing the account key to be stored as a flowfile attribute. While it does provide for a more flexible flow by allowing the account key to be fetched dynamically from a flow file attribute, care must be taken to restrict access to the event provenance data (e.g. by strictly controlling the policies governing provenance for this Processor). In addition, the provenance repositories may be put on encrypted disk partitions.
storage-sas-token.displayName=SAS Token
storage-sas-token.description=Shared Access Signature token, including the leading '?'. Specify either SAS Token (recommended) or Account Key. There are certain risks in allowing the SAS token to be stored as a flowfile attribute. While it does provide for a more flexible flow by allowing the account name to be fetched dynamically from a flowfile attribute, care must be taken to restrict access to the event provenance data (e.g. by strictly controlling the policies governing provenance for this Processor). In addition, the provenance repositories may be put on encrypted disk partitions.
time-to-live.displayName=TTL
time-to-live.description=Maximum time to allow the message to be in the queue. If left empty, the default value of 7 days will be used.
storage-queue-name.displayName=Queue Name
storage-queue-name.description=Name of the Azure Storage Queue
visibility-delay.displayName=Visibility Delay
visibility-delay.description=The length of time during which the message will be invisible, starting when it is added to the queue. This value must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than the TTL value.
proxy-configuration-service.displayName=Proxy Configuration Service
proxy-configuration-service.description=Specifies the Proxy Configuration Controller Service to proxy network requests. Supported proxies\: HTTP, SOCKS
__Relationship.success.description=All successfully processed FlowFiles are routed to this relationship
__Relationship.failure.description=Unsuccessful operations will be transferred to the failure relationship.
