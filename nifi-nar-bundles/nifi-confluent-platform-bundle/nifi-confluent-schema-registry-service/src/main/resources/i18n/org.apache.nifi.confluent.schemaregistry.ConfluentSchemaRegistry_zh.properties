__CapabilityDescription=Provides a Schema Registry that interacts with the Confluent Schema Registry so that those Schemas that are stored in the Confluent Schema Registry can be used in NiFi. The Confluent Schema Registry has a notion of a "subject" for schemas, which is their terminology for a schema name. When a Schema is looked up by name by this registry, it will find a Schema in the Confluent Schema Registry with that subject.
