__CapabilityDescription=Calculates a fuzzy/locality-sensitive hash value for the Content of a FlowFile and puts that hash value on the FlowFile as an attribute whose name is determined by the <Hash Attribute Name> property.Note\: this processor only offers non-cryptographic hash algorithms. And it should be not be seen as a replacement to the HashContent processor.Note\: The underlying library loads the entirety of the streamed content into and performs result evaluations in memory. Accordingly, it is important to consider the anticipated profile of content being evaluated by this processor and the hardware supporting it especially when working against large files.
__Tags=hashing, fuzzy-hashing, cyber-security
ATTRIBUTE_NAME.displayName=Hash Attribute Name
ATTRIBUTE_NAME.description=The name of the FlowFile Attribute that should hold the Fuzzy Hash Value
HASH_ALGORITHM.displayName=Hashing Algorithm
HASH_ALGORITHM.description=The hashing algorithm utilised
__AllowableValue.HASH_ALGORITHM.ssdeep.displayName=ssdeep
__AllowableValue.HASH_ALGORITHM.ssdeep.description=Uses ssdeep / SpamSum 'context triggered piecewise hash'.
__AllowableValue.HASH_ALGORITHM.tlsh.displayName=tlsh
__AllowableValue.HASH_ALGORITHM.tlsh.description=Uses TLSH (Trend 'Locality Sensitive Hash'). Note\: FlowFile Content must be at least 512 characters long
__Relationship.success.description=Any FlowFile that is successfully hashed will be sent to this Relationship.
__Relationship.failure.description=Any FlowFile that is successfully hashed will be sent to this Relationship.
__WritesAttribute.Hash_Attribute_Name.description=This Processor adds an attribute whose value is the result of Hashing the existing FlowFile content. The name of this attribute is specified by the <Hash Attribute Name> property
