__CapabilityDescription=Retrieves a document from Elasticsearch using the specified connection properties and the identifier of the document to retrieve. If the cluster has been configured for authorization and/or secure transport (SSL/TLS), and the X-Pack plugin is available, secure connections can be made. This processor supports Elasticsearch 5.x clusters.
__Tags=elasticsearch, elasticsearch 5, fetch, read, get
el5-cluster-name.displayName=Cluster Name
el5-cluster-name.description=Name of the ES cluster (for example, elasticsearch_brew). Defaults to 'elasticsearch'
el5-hosts.displayName=ElasticSearch Hosts
el5-hosts.description=ElasticSearch Hosts, which should be comma separated and colon for hostname/port host1\:port,host2\:port,....  For example testcluster\:9300. This processor uses the Transport Client to connect to hosts. The default transport client port is 9300.
el5-ssl-context-service.displayName=SSL Context Service
el5-ssl-context-service.description=The SSL Context Service used to provide client certificate information for TLS/SSL connections. This service only applies if the Elasticsearch endpoint(s) have been secured with TLS/SSL.
el5-xpack-location.displayName=X-Pack Transport Location
el5-xpack-location.description=Specifies the path to the JAR(s) for the Elasticsearch X-Pack Transport feature. If the Elasticsearch cluster has been secured with the X-Pack plugin, then the X-Pack Transport JARs must also be available to this processor. Note\: Do NOT place the X-Pack JARs into NiFi's lib/ directory, doing so will prevent the X-Pack Transport JARs from being loaded.
el5-username.displayName=Username
el5-username.description=Username to access the Elasticsearch cluster
el5-password.displayName=Password
el5-password.description=Password to access the Elasticsearch cluster
el5-ping-timeout.displayName=ElasticSearch Ping Timeout
el5-ping-timeout.description=The ping timeout used to determine when a node is unreachable. For example, 5s (5 seconds). If non-local recommended is 30s
el5-sampler-interval.displayName=Sampler Interval
el5-sampler-interval.description=How often to sample / ping the nodes listed and connected. For example, 5s (5 seconds). If non-local recommended is 30s.

el5-fetch-doc-id.description=The identifier for the document to be fetched
el5-fetch-index.displayName=Index
el5-fetch-index.description=The name of the index to read from
el5-fetch-type.displayName=Type
el5-fetch-type.description=The type of this document (used by Elasticsearch for indexing and searching)
el5-charset.displayName=Character Set
el5-charset.description=Specifies the character set of the document data.
__Relationship.retry.description=A FlowFile is routed to this relationship if the document cannot be fetched but attempting the operation again may succeed
__Relationship.success.description=All FlowFiles that are read from Elasticsearch are routed to this relationship
__Relationship.failure.description=All FlowFiles that cannot be read from Elasticsearch are routed to this relationship
__Relationship.not_found.description=A FlowFile is routed to this relationship if the specified document does not exist in the Elasticsearch cluster
__WritesAttribute.filename.description=The filename attributes is set to the document identifier
__WritesAttribute.es.index.description=The Elasticsearch index containing the document
__WritesAttribute.es.type.description=The Elasticsearch document type
