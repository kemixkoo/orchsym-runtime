__CapabilityDescription=Retrieves a document from Elasticsearch using the specified connection properties and the identifier of the document to retrieve. If the cluster has been configured for authorization and/or secure transport (SSL/TLS) and the Shield plugin is available, secure connections can be made. This processor supports Elasticsearch 2.x clusters.
__Tags=elasticsearch, fetch, read, get
Cluster_Name.displayName=Cluster Name
Cluster_Name.description=Name of the ES cluster (for example, elasticsearch_brew). Defaults to 'elasticsearch'
