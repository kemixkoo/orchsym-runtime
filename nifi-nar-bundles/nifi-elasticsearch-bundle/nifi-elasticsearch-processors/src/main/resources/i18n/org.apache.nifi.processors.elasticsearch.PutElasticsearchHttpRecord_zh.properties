__CapabilityDescription=Writes the records from a FlowFile into to Elasticsearch, using the specified parameters such as the index to insert into and the type of the document, as well as the operation type (index, upsert, delete, etc.). Note\: The Bulk API is used to send the records. This means that the entire contents of the incoming flow file are read into memory, and each record is transformed into a JSON document which is added to a single HTTP request body. For very large flow files (files with a large number of records, e.g.), this could cause memory usage issues.
