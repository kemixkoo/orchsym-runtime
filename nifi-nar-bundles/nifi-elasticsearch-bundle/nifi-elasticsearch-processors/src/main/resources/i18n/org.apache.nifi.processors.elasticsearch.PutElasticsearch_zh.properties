__CapabilityDescription=Writes the contents of a FlowFile to Elasticsearch, using the specified parameters such as the index to insert into and the type of the document. If the cluster has been configured for authorization and/or secure transport (SSL/TLS) and the Shield plugin is available, secure connections can be made. This processor supports Elasticsearch 2.x clusters.
__Tags=elasticsearch, insert, update, write, put
Cluster_Name.displayName=Cluster Name
Cluster_Name.description=Name of the ES cluster (for example, elasticsearch_brew). Defaults to 'elasticsearch'
ElasticSearch_Hosts.displayName=ElasticSearch Hosts
ElasticSearch_Hosts.description=ElasticSearch Hosts, which should be comma separated and colon for hostname/port host1\:port,host2\:port,....  For example testcluster\:9300. This processor uses the Transport Client to connect to hosts. The default transport client port is 9300.
SSL_Context_Service.displayName=SSL Context Service
SSL_Context_Service.description=The SSL Context Service used to provide client certificate information for TLS/SSL connections. This service only applies if the Elasticsearch endpoint(s) have been secured with TLS/SSL.
Shield_Plugin_Filename.displayName=Shield Plugin Filename
Shield_Plugin_Filename.description=Specifies the path to the JAR for the Elasticsearch Shield plugin. If the Elasticsearch cluster has been secured with the Shield plugin, then the Shield plugin JAR must also be available to this processor. Note\: Do NOT place the Shield JAR into NiFi's lib/ directory, doing so will prevent the Shield plugin from being loaded.
Username.displayName=Username
Username.description=Username to access the Elasticsearch cluster
Password.displayName=Password
Password.description=Password to access the Elasticsearch cluster
ElasticSearch_Ping_Timeout.displayName=ElasticSearch Ping Timeout
ElasticSearch_Ping_Timeout.description=The ping timeout used to determine when a node is unreachable. For example, 5s (5 seconds). If non-local recommended is 30s
Sampler_Interval.displayName=Sampler Interval
Sampler_Interval.description=How often to sample / ping the nodes listed and connected. For example, 5s (5 seconds). If non-local recommended is 30s.
Identifier_Attribute.displayName=Identifier Attribute
Identifier_Attribute.description=The name of the attribute containing the identifier for each FlowFile
Index.displayName=Index
Index.description=The name of the index to insert into
Type.displayName=Type
Type.description=The type of this document (used by Elasticsearch for indexing and searching)
Character_Set.displayName=Character Set
Character_Set.description=Specifies the character set of the document data.
Batch_Size.displayName=Batch Size
Batch_Size.description=The preferred number of FlowFiles to put to the database in a single transaction
Index_Operation.displayName=Index Operation
Index_Operation.description=The type of the operation used to index (index, update, upsert)
__Relationship.retry.description=A FlowFile is routed to this relationship if the database cannot be updated but attempting the operation again may succeed
__Relationship.success.description=All FlowFiles that are written to Elasticsearch are routed to this relationship
__Relationship.failure.description=All FlowFiles that cannot be written to Elasticsearch are routed to this relationship
__SystemResource.MEMORY.description=An instance of this component can cause high usage of this system resource.  Multiple instances or high concurrency settings may result a degradation of performance.
