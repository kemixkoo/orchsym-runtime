__CapabilityDescription=Scrolls through an Elasticsearch query using the specified connection properties. This processor is intended to be run on the primary node, and is designed for scrolling through huge result sets, as in the case of a reindex.  The state must be cleared before another query can be run.  Each page of results is returned, wrapped in a JSON object like so\: { "hits" \: [ <doc1>, <doc2>, <docn> ] }.  Note that the full body of each page of documents will be read into memory before being written to a Flow File for transfer.
