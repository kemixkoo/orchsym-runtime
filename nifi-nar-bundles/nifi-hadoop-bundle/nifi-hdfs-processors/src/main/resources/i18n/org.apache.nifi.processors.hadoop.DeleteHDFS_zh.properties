__CapabilityDescription=Deletes one or more files or directories from HDFS. The path can be provided as an attribute from an incoming FlowFile, or a statically set path that is periodically removed. If this processor has an incoming connection, itwill ignore running on a periodic basis and instead rely on incoming FlowFiles to trigger a delete. Note that you may use a wildcard character to match multiple files or directories. If there are no incoming connections no flowfiles will be transfered to any output relationships.  If there is an incoming flowfile then provided there are no detected failures it will be transferred to success otherwise it will be sent to false. If knowledge of globbed files deleted is necessary use ListHDFS first to produce a specific list of files to delete.

__Relationship.success.description=When an incoming flowfile is used then if there are no errors invoking delete the flowfile will route here.
__Relationship.failure.description=When an incoming flowfile is used and there is a failure while deleting then the flowfile will route here.
__WritesAttribute.hdfs.filename.description=HDFS file to be deleted. If multiple files are deleted, then only the last filename is set.
