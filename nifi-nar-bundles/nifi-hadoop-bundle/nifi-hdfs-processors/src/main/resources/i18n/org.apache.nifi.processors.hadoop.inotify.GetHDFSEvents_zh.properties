__CapabilityDescription=This processor polls the notification events provided by the HdfsAdmin API. Since this uses the HdfsAdmin APIs it is required to run as an HDFS super user. Currently there are six types of events (append, close, create, metadata, rename, and unlink). Please see org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.inotify.Event documentation for full explanations of each event. This processor will poll for new events based on a defined duration. For each event received a new flow file will be created with the expected attributes and the event itself serialized to JSON and written to the flow file's content. For example, if event.type is APPEND then the content of the flow file will contain a JSON file containing the information about the append event. If successful the flow files are sent to the 'success' relationship. Be careful of where the generated flow files are stored. If the flow files are stored in one of processor's watch directories there will be a never ending flow of events. It is also important to be aware that this processor must consume all events. The filtering must happen within the processor. This is because the HDFS admin's event notifications API does not have filtering.

Hadoop_Configuration_Resources.displayName=Hadoop Configuration Resources
Hadoop_Configuration_Resources.description=A file or comma separated list of files which contains the Hadoop file system configuration. Without this, Hadoop will search the classpath for a 'core-site.xml' and 'hdfs-site.xml' file or will revert to a default configuration. To use swebhdfs, see 'Additional Details' section of PutHDFS's documentation.
kerberos-credentials-service.displayName=Kerberos Credentials Service
kerberos-credentials-service.description=Specifies the Kerberos Credentials Controller Service that should be used for authenticating with Kerberos
Kerberos_Principal.displayName=Kerberos Principal
Kerberos_Principal.description=Kerberos principal to authenticate as. Requires nifi.kerberos.krb5.file to be set in your nifi.properties
Kerberos_Keytab.displayName=Kerberos Keytab
Kerberos_Keytab.description=Kerberos keytab associated with the principal. Requires nifi.kerberos.krb5.file to be set in your nifi.properties
Kerberos_Relogin_Period.displayName=Kerberos Relogin Period
Kerberos_Relogin_Period.description=Period of time which should pass before attempting a kerberos relogin.\n\nThis property has been deprecated, and has no effect on processing. Relogins now occur automatically.
Additional_Classpath_Resources.displayName=Additional Classpath Resources
Additional_Classpath_Resources.description=A comma-separated list of paths to files and/or directories that will be added to the classpath. When specifying a directory, all files with in the directory will be added to the classpath, but further sub-directories will not be included.
Poll_Duration.displayName=Poll Duration
Poll_Duration.description=The time before the polling method returns with the next batch of events if they exist. It may exceed this amount of time by up to the time required for an RPC to the NameNode.
HDFS_Path_to_Watch.displayName=HDFS Path to Watch
HDFS_Path_to_Watch.description=The HDFS path to get event notifications for. This property accepts both expression language and regular expressions. This will be evaluated during the OnScheduled phase.
Ignore_Hidden_Files.displayName=Ignore Hidden Files
Ignore_Hidden_Files.description=If true and the final component of the path associated with a given event starts with a '.' then that event will not be processed.
__AllowableValue.Ignore_Hidden_Files.false.displayName=false
__AllowableValue.Ignore_Hidden_Files.true.displayName=true
Event_Types_to_Filter_On.displayName=Event Types to Filter On
Event_Types_to_Filter_On.description=A comma-separated list of event types to process. Valid event types are\: append, close, create, metadata, rename, and unlink. Case does not matter.
IOException_Retries_During_Event_Polling.displayName=IOException Retries During Event Polling
IOException_Retries_During_Event_Polling.description=According to the HDFS admin API for event polling it is good to retry at least a few times. This number defines how many times the poll will be retried if it throws an IOException.
__Relationship.success.description=A flow file with updated information about a specific event will be sent to this relationship.
__WritesAttribute.mime.type.description=This is always application/json.
__WritesAttribute.hdfs.inotify.event.type.description=This will specify the specific HDFS notification event type. Currently there are six types of events (append, close, create, metadata, rename, and unlink).
__WritesAttribute.hdfs.inotify.event.path.description=The specific path that the event is tied to.
__Stateful.description=The last used transaction id is stored. This is used
