__CapabilityDescription=This Processor polls HBase for any records in the specified table. The processor keeps track of the timestamp of the cells that it receives, so that as new records are pushed to HBase, they will automatically be pulled. Each record is output in JSON format, as {"row"\: "<row key>", "cells"\: { "<column 1 family>\:<column 1 qualifier>"\: "<cell 1 value>", "<column 2 family>\:<column 2 qualifier>"\: "<cell 2 value>", ... }}. For each record received, a Provenance RECEIVE event is emitted with the format hbase\://<table name>/<row key>, where <row key> is the UTF-8 encoded value of the row's key.
__Tags=hbase, get, ingest
HBase_Client_Service.displayName=HBase Client Service
HBase_Client_Service.description=Specifies the Controller Service to use for accessing HBase.
Distributed_Cache_Service.displayName=Distributed Cache Service
Distributed_Cache_Service.description=Specifies the Controller Service that should be used to maintain state about what has been pulled from HBase so that if a new node begins pulling data, it won't duplicate all of the work that has been done.
Table_Name.displayName=Table Name
Table_Name.description=The name of the HBase Table to put data into
Columns.displayName=Columns
Columns.description=A comma-separated list of "<colFamily>\:<colQualifier>" pairs to return when scanning. To return all columns for a given family, leave off the qualifier such as "<colFamily1>,<colFamily2>".
hbase-fetch-row-authorizations.displayName=Authorizations
hbase-fetch-row-authorizations.description=The list of authorizations to pass to the scanner. This will be ignored if cell visibility labels are not in use.
Filter_Expression.displayName=Filter Expression
Filter_Expression.description=An HBase filter expression that will be applied to the scan. This property can not be used when also using the Columns property.
Initial_Time_Range.displayName=Initial Time Range
Initial_Time_Range.description=The time range to use on the first scan of a table. None will pull the entire table on the first scan, Current Time will pull entries from that point forward.
__AllowableValue.Initial_Time_Range.Current_Time.displayName=Current Time
__AllowableValue.Initial_Time_Range.None.displayName=None
Character_Set.displayName=Character Set
Character_Set.description=Specifies which character set is used to encode the data in HBase
__Relationship.success.description=All FlowFiles are routed to this relationship
__WritesAttribute.hbase.table.description=The name of the HBase table that the data was pulled from
__WritesAttribute.mime.type.description=Set to application/json to indicate that output is JSON
__Stateful.description=After performing a fetching from HBase, stores a timestamp of the last-modified cell that was found. In addition, it stores the ID of the row(s) and the value of each cell that has that timestamp as its modification date. This is stored across the cluster and allows the next fetch to avoid duplicating data, even if this Processor is run on Primary Node only and the Primary Node changes.
