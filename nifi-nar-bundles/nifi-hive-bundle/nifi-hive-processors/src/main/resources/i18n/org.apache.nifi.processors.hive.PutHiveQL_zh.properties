__CapabilityDescription=Executes a HiveQL DDL/DML command (UPDATE, INSERT, e.g.). The content of an incoming FlowFile is expected to be the HiveQL command to execute. The HiveQL command may use the ? to escape parameters. In this case, the parameters to use must exist as FlowFile attributes with the naming convention hiveql.args.N.type and hiveql.args.N.value, where N is a positive integer. The hiveql.args.N.type is expected to be a number indicating the JDBC Type. The content of the FlowFile is expected to be in UTF-8 format.
__Tags=sql, hive, put, database, update, insert
Hive_Database_Connection_Pooling_Service.displayName=Hive Database Connection Pooling Service
Hive_Database_Connection_Pooling_Service.description=The Hive Controller Service that is used to obtain connection(s) to the Hive database
hive-batch-size.displayName=Batch Size
hive-batch-size.description=The preferred number of FlowFiles to put to the database in a single transaction
hive-charset.displayName=Character Set
hive-charset.description=Specifies the character set of the record data.
statement-delimiter.displayName=Statement Delimiter
statement-delimiter.description=Statement Delimiter used to separate SQL statements in a multiple statement script
rollback-on-failure.displayName=Rollback On Failure
rollback-on-failure.description=Specify how to handle error. By default (false), if an error occurs while processing a FlowFile, the FlowFile will be routed to 'failure' or 'retry' relationship based on error type, and processor can continue with next FlowFile. Instead, you may want to rollback currently processed FlowFiles and stop further processing immediately. In that case, you can do so by enabling this 'Rollback On Failure' property.  If enabled, failed FlowFiles will stay in the input relationship without penalizing it and being processed repeatedly until it gets processed successfully or removed by other means. It is important to set adequate 'Yield Duration' to avoid retrying too frequently.
__AllowableValue.rollback-on-failure.false.displayName=false
__AllowableValue.rollback-on-failure.true.displayName=true
__Relationship.retry.description=A FlowFile is routed to this relationship if the database cannot be updated but attempting the operation again may succeed
__Relationship.success.description=A FlowFile is routed to this relationship after the database is successfully updated
__Relationship.failure.description=A FlowFile is routed to this relationship if the database cannot be updated and retrying the operation will also fail, such as an invalid query or an integrity constraint violation
__ReadsAttribute.hiveql.args.N.type.description=Incoming FlowFiles are expected to be parametrized HiveQL statements. The type of each Parameter is specified as an integer that represents the JDBC Type of the parameter.
__ReadsAttribute.hiveql.args.N.value.description=Incoming FlowFiles are expected to be parametrized HiveQL statements. The value of the Parameters are specified as hiveql.args.1.value, hiveql.args.2.value, hiveql.args.3.value, and so on. The type of the hiveql.args.1.value Parameter is specified by the hiveql.args.1.type attribute.
__WritesAttribute.query.input.tables.description=This attribute is written on the flow files routed to the 'success' relationships, and contains input table names (if any) in comma delimited 'databaseName.tableName' format.
__WritesAttribute.query.output.tables.description=This attribute is written on the flow files routed to the 'success' relationships, and contains the target table names in 'databaseName.tableName' format.
