header-name-regex.description=A Regular Expression that is matched against all message headers. Any message header whose name matches the regex will be added to the FlowFile as an Attribute. If not specified, no Header values will be added as FlowFile attributes. If two messages have a different value for the same header and that header is selected by the provided regex, then those two messages must be added to different FlowFiles. As a result, users should be cautious about using a regex like \".*\" if messages are expected to have header values that are unique per message, such as an identifier or timestamp, because it will prevent platform from bundling the messages together efficiently.
