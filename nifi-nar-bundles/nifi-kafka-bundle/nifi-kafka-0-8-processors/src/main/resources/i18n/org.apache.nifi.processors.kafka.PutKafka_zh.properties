__CapabilityDescription=Sends the contents of a FlowFile as a message to Apache Kafka, specifically for 0.8.x versions. The messages to send may be individual FlowFiles or may be delimited, using a user-specified delimiter, such as a new-line. The complementary NiFi processor for fetching messages is GetKafka.
__Tags=Apache, Kafka, Put, Send, Message, PubSub, 0.8.x
Known_Brokers.displayName=Known Brokers
Known_Brokers.description=A comma-separated list of known Kafka Brokers in the format <host>\:<port>
Topic_Name.displayName=Topic Name
Topic_Name.description=The Kafka Topic of interest
Partition.displayName=Partition
Partition.description=Specifies which Kafka Partition to add the message to. If using a message delimiter, all messages in the same FlowFile will be sent to the same partition. If a partition is specified but is not valid, then the FlowFile will be routed to failure relationship.
Kafka_Key.displayName=Kafka Key
Kafka_Key.description=The Key to use for the Message
Delivery_Guarantee.displayName=Delivery Guarantee
Delivery_Guarantee.description=Specifies the requirement for guaranteeing that a message is sent to Kafka
__AllowableValue.Delivery_Guarantee.0.displayName=Best Effort
__AllowableValue.Delivery_Guarantee.0.description=FlowFile will be routed to success after successfully writing the content to a Kafka node, without waiting for a response. This provides the best performance but may result in data loss.
__AllowableValue.Delivery_Guarantee.1.displayName=Guarantee Single Node Delivery
__AllowableValue.Delivery_Guarantee.1.description=FlowFile will be routed to success if the message is received by a single Kafka node, whether or not it is replicated. This is faster than <Guarantee Replicated Delivery> but can result in data loss if a Kafka node crashes
__AllowableValue.Delivery_Guarantee.all.displayName=Guarantee Replicated Delivery
__AllowableValue.Delivery_Guarantee.all.description=FlowFile will be routed to failure unless the message is replicated to the appropriate number of Kafka Nodes according to the Topic configuration
Message_Delimiter.displayName=Message Delimiter
Message_Delimiter.description=Specifies the delimiter (interpreted in its UTF-8 byte representation) to use for splitting apart multiple messages within a single FlowFile. If not specified, the entire content of the FlowFile will be used as a single message. If specified, the contents of the FlowFile will be split on this delimiter and each section sent as a separate Kafka message. Note that if messages are delimited and some messages for a given FlowFile are transferred successfully while others are not, the messages will be split into individual FlowFiles, such that those messages that were successfully sent are routed to the 'success' relationship while other messages are sent to the 'failure' relationship.
Max_Buffer_Size.displayName=Max Buffer Size
Max_Buffer_Size.description=The maximum amount of data to buffer in memory before sending to Kafka
Max_Record_Size.displayName=Max Record Size
Max_Record_Size.description=The maximum size that any individual record can be.
Communications_Timeout.displayName=Communications Timeout
Communications_Timeout.description=The amount of time to wait for a response from Kafka before determining that there is a communications error
Async_Batch_Size.displayName=Batch Size
Async_Batch_Size.description=This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes.The producer will attempt to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are being sent to the same partition. This helps performance on both the client and the server.
Queue_Buffering_Max_Time.displayName=Queue Buffering Max Time
Queue_Buffering_Max_Time.description=Maximum time to buffer data before sending to Kafka. For example a setting of 100 ms will try to batch together 100 milliseconds' worth of messages to send at once. This will improve throughput but adds message delivery latency due to the buffering.
Compression_Codec.displayName=Compression Codec
Compression_Codec.description=This parameter allows you to specify the compression codec for all data generated by this producer.
__AllowableValue.Compression_Codec.gzip.displayName=GZIP
__AllowableValue.Compression_Codec.gzip.description=Compress messages using GZIP
__AllowableValue.Compression_Codec.none.displayName=None
__AllowableValue.Compression_Codec.none.description=Compression will not be used for any topic.
__AllowableValue.Compression_Codec.snappy.displayName=Snappy
__AllowableValue.Compression_Codec.snappy.description=Compress messages using Snappy
Client_Name.displayName=Client Name
Client_Name.description=Client Name to use when communicating with Kafka
The_name_of_a_Kafka_configuration_property..description=These properties will be added on the Kafka configuration after loading any provided configuration properties. In the event a dynamic property represents a property that was already set as part of the static properties, its value wil be overriden with warning message describing the override. For the list of available Kafka properties please refer to\: http\://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html\#configuration.
__Relationship.success.description=Any FlowFile that is successfully sent to Kafka will be routed to this Relationship
__Relationship.failure.description=Any FlowFile that cannot be sent to Kafka will be routed to this Relationship
