__CapabilityDescription=An implementation of DistributedMapCacheClient that uses Redis as the backing cache. This service relies on the WATCH, MULTI, and EXEC commands in Redis, which are not fully supported when Redis is clustered. As a result, this service can only be used with a Redis Connection Pool that is configured for standalone or sentinel mode. Sentinel mode can be used to provide high-availability configurations.
