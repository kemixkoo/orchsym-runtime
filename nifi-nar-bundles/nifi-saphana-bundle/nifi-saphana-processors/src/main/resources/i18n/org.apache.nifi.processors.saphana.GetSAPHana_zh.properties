__CapabilityDescription=Execute provided SQL select query. Query result will be converted to Avro format. Streaming is used so arbitrarily large result sets are supported. This processor can be scheduled to run on a timer, or cron expression, using the standard scheduling methods, or it can be triggered by an incoming FlowFile. If it is triggered by an incoming FlowFile, then attributes of that FlowFile will be available when evaluating the select query. FlowFile attribute 'getsaphana.row.count' indicates how many rows were selected.

Database_Connection_Pooling_Service.displayName=Database Connection Pooling Service
Database_Connection_Pooling_Service.description=The Controller Service that is used to obtain connection to database
SQL_select_query.displayName=SQL select query
SQL_select_query.description=The SQL select query to execute. The query can be empty, a constant value, or built from attributes using Expression Language. If this property is specified, it will be used regardless of the content of incoming flowfiles. If this property is empty, the content of the incoming flow file is expected to contain a valid SQL select query, to be issued by the processor to the database. Note that Expression Language is not evaluated for flow file contents.
Max_Wait_Time.displayName=Max Wait Time
Max_Wait_Time.description=The maximum amount of time allowed for a running SQL select query  , zero means there is no limit. Max time less than 1 second will be equal to zero.
dbf-normalize.displayName=Normalize Table/Column Names
dbf-normalize.description=Whether to change non-Avro-compatible characters in column names to Avro-compatible characters. For example, colons and periods will be changed to underscores in order to build a valid Avro record.
__AllowableValue.dbf-normalize.true.displayName=true
__AllowableValue.dbf-normalize.false.displayName=false
dbf-user-logical-types.displayName=Use Avro Logical Types
dbf-user-logical-types.description=Whether to use Avro Logical Types for DECIMAL/NUMBER, DATE, TIME and TIMESTAMP columns. If disabled, written as string. If enabled, Logical types are used and written as its underlying type, specifically, DECIMAL/NUMBER as logical 'decimal'\: written as bytes with additional precision and scale meta data, DATE as logical 'date-millis'\: written as int denoting days since Unix epoch (1970-01-01), TIME as logical 'time-millis'\: written as int denoting milliseconds since Unix epoch, and TIMESTAMP as logical 'timestamp-millis'\: written as long denoting milliseconds since Unix epoch. If a reader of written Avro records also knows these logical types, then these values can be deserialized with more context depending on reader implementation.
__AllowableValue.dbf-user-logical-types.true.displayName=true
__AllowableValue.dbf-user-logical-types.false.displayName=false
dbf-default-precision.displayName=Default Decimal Precision
dbf-default-precision.description=When a DECIMAL/NUMBER value is written as a 'decimal' Avro logical type, a specific 'precision' denoting number of available digits is required. Generally, precision is defined by column data type definition or database engines default. However undefined precision (0) can be returned from some database engines. 'Default Decimal Precision' is used when writing those undefined precision numbers.
dbf-default-scale.displayName=Default Decimal Scale
dbf-default-scale.description=When a DECIMAL/NUMBER value is written as a 'decimal' Avro logical type, a specific 'scale' denoting number of available decimal digits is required. Generally, scale is defined by column data type definition or database engines default. However when undefined precision (0) is returned, scale can also be uncertain with some database engines. 'Default Decimal Scale' is used when writing those undefined numbers. If a value has more decimals than specified scale, then the value will be rounded-up, e.g. 1.53 becomes 2 with scale 0, and 1.5 with scale 1.
__Relationship.success.description=Successfully created FlowFile from SQL query result set.
__Relationship.failure.description=SQL query execution failed. Incoming FlowFile will be penalized and routed to this relationship
__WritesAttribute.getsaphana.row.count.description=Contains the number of rows returned in the select query
__WritesAttribute.getsaphana.query.duration.description=Duration of the query in milliseconds
