__CapabilityDescription=Controls the rate at which data is transferred to follow-on processors. If you configure a very small Time Duration, then the accuracy of the throttle gets worse. You can improve this accuracy by decreasing the Yield Duration, at the expense of more Tasks given to the processor.
__Tags=rate control, throttle, rate, throughput
Rate_Control_Criteria.displayName=Rate Control Criteria
Rate_Control_Criteria.description=Indicates the criteria that is used to control the throughput rate. Changing this value resets the rate counters.
__AllowableValue.Rate_Control_Criteria.data_rate.displayName=data rate
__AllowableValue.Rate_Control_Criteria.data_rate.description=Rate is controlled by counting bytes transferred per time duration.
__AllowableValue.Rate_Control_Criteria.flowfile_count.displayName=flowfile count
__AllowableValue.Rate_Control_Criteria.flowfile_count.description=Rate is controlled by counting flowfiles transferred per time duration
__AllowableValue.Rate_Control_Criteria.attribute_value.displayName=attribute value
__AllowableValue.Rate_Control_Criteria.attribute_value.description=Rate is controlled by accumulating the value of a specified attribute that is transferred per time duration
Maximum_Rate.displayName=Maximum Rate
Maximum_Rate.description=The maximum rate at which data should pass through this processor. The format of this property is expected to be a positive integer, or a Data Size (such as '1 MB') if Rate Control Criteria is set to 'data rate'.
Rate_Controlled_Attribute.displayName=Rate Controlled Attribute
Rate_Controlled_Attribute.description=The name of an attribute whose values build toward the rate limit if Rate Control Criteria is set to 'attribute value'. The value of the attribute referenced by this property must be a positive long, or the FlowFile will be routed to failure. This value is ignored if Rate Control Criteria is not set to 'attribute value'. Changing this value resets the rate counters.
Time_Duration.displayName=Time Duration
Time_Duration.description=The amount of time to which the Maximum Rate pertains. Changing this value resets the rate counters.
Grouping_Attribute.displayName=Grouping Attribute
Grouping_Attribute.description=By default, a single "throttle" is used for all FlowFiles. If this value is specified, a separate throttle is used for each value specified by the attribute with this name. Changing this value resets the rate counters.
__Relationship.success.description=FlowFiles are transferred to this relationship under normal conditions
__Relationship.failure.description=FlowFiles will be routed to this relationship if they are missing a necessary Rate Controlled Attribute or the attribute is not in the expected format
