__CapabilityDescription=Caches a value, computed from FlowFile attributes, for each incoming FlowFile and determines if the cached value has already been seen. If so, routes the FlowFile to 'duplicate' with an attribute named 'original.identifier' that specifies the original FlowFile's "description", which is specified in the <FlowFile Description> property. If the FlowFile is not determined to be a duplicate, the Processor routes the FlowFile to 'non-duplicate'
__Tags=hash, dupe, duplicate, dedupe
Cache_Entry_Identifier.displayName=Cache Entry Identifier
Cache_Entry_Identifier.description=A FlowFile attribute, or the results of an Attribute Expression Language statement, which will be evaluated against a FlowFile in order to determine the value used to identify duplicates; it is this value that is cached
FlowFile_Description.displayName=FlowFile Description
FlowFile_Description.description=When a FlowFile is added to the cache, this value is stored along with it so that if a duplicate is found, this description of the original FlowFile will be added to the duplicate's "original.flowfile.description" attribute
Age_Off_Duration.displayName=Age Off Duration
Age_Off_Duration.description=Time interval to age off cached FlowFiles
Distributed_Cache_Service.displayName=Distributed Cache Service
Distributed_Cache_Service.description=The Controller Service that is used to cache unique identifiers, used to determine duplicates
Cache_The_Entry_Identifier.displayName=Cache The Entry Identifier
Cache_The_Entry_Identifier.description=When true this cause the processor to check for duplicates and cache the Entry Identifier. When false, the processor would only check for duplicates and not cache the Entry Identifier, requiring another processor to add identifiers to the distributed cache.
__AllowableValue.Cache_The_Entry_Identifier.true.displayName=\u7f13\u5b58
__AllowableValue.Cache_The_Entry_Identifier.false.displayName=\u4e0d\u7f13\u5b58
__Relationship.duplicate.description=If a FlowFile has been detected to be a duplicate, it will be routed to this relationship
__Relationship.non-duplicate.description=If a FlowFile's Cache Entry Identifier was not found in the cache, it will be routed to this relationship
__Relationship.failure.description=If unable to communicate with the cache, the FlowFile will be penalized and routed to this relationship
__WritesAttribute.original.flowfile.description.description=All FlowFiles routed to the duplicate relationship will have an attribute added named original.flowfile.description. The value of this attribute is determined by the attributes of the original copy of the data and by the FlowFile Description property.
