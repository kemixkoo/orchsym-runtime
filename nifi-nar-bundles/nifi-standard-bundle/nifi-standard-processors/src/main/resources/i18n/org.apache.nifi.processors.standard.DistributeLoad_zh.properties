__CapabilityDescription=Distributes FlowFiles to downstream processors based on a Distribution Strategy. If using the Round Robin strategy, the default is to assign each destination a weighting of 1 (evenly distributed). However, optional propertiescan be added to the change this; adding a property with the name '5' and value '10' means that the relationship with name '5' will be receive 10 FlowFiles in each iteration instead of 1.

Distribution_Strategy.description=Determines how the load will be distributed. If using Round Robin, will not distribute any FlowFiles unless all destinations can accept FlowFiles; when using Next Available, will distribute FlowFiles as long as at least 1 destination can accept FlowFiles.
