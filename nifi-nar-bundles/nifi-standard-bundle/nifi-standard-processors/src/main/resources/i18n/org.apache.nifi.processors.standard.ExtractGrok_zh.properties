__CapabilityDescription=Evaluates one or more Grok Expressions against the content of a FlowFile, adding the results as attributes or replacing the content of the FlowFile with a JSON notation of the matched content
__Tags=grok, log, text, parse, delimit, extract
Grok_Expression.displayName=Grok Expression
Grok_Expression.description=Grok expression
Grok_Pattern_file.displayName=Grok Pattern file
Grok_Pattern_file.description=Grok Pattern file definition
Destination.displayName=Destination
Destination.description=Control if Grok output value is written as a new flowfile attributes, in this case each of the Grok identifier that is matched in the flowfile will be added as an attribute, prefixed with "grok." or written in the flowfile content. Writing to flowfile content will overwrite any existing flowfile content.
__AllowableValue.Destination.flowfile-attribute.displayName=flowfile-attribute
__AllowableValue.Destination.flowfile-content.displayName=flowfile-content
Character_Set.displayName=Character Set
Character_Set.description=The Character Set in which the file is encoded
Maximum_Buffer_Size.displayName=Maximum Buffer Size
Maximum_Buffer_Size.description=Specifies the maximum amount of data to buffer (per file) in order to apply the Grok expressions. Files larger than the specified maximum will not be fully evaluated.
Named_captures_only.displayName=Named captures only
Named_captures_only.description=Only store named captures from grok
__AllowableValue.Named_captures_only.true.displayName=true
__AllowableValue.Named_captures_only.false.displayName=false
__Relationship.unmatched.description=FlowFiles are routed to this relationship when no provided Grok Expression matches the content of the FlowFile
__Relationship.matched.description=FlowFiles are routed to this relationship when the Grok Expression is successfully evaluated and the FlowFile is modified as a result
__WritesAttribute.grok.XXX.description=When operating in flowfile-attribute mode, each of the Grok identifier that is matched in the flowfile will be added as an attribute, prefixed with "grok." For example,if the grok identifier "timestamp" is matched, then the value will be added to an attribute named "grok.timestamp"
