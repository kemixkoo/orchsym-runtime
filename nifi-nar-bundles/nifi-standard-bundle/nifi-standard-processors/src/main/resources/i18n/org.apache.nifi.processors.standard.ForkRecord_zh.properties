__CapabilityDescription=This processor allows the user to fork a record into multiple records. The user must specify at least one Record Path, as a dynamic property, pointing to a field of type ARRAY containing RECORD objects. The processor accepts two modes\: 'split' and 'extract'. In both modes, there is one record generated per element contained in the designated array. In the 'split' mode, each generated record will preserve the same schema as given in the input but the array will contain only one element. In the 'extract' mode, the element of the array must be of record type and will be the generated record. Additionally, in the 'extract' mode, it is possible to specify if each generated record should contain all the fields of the parent records from the root level to the extracted record. This assumes that the fields to add in the record are defined in the schema of the Record Writer controller service. See examples in the additional details documentation of this processor.
