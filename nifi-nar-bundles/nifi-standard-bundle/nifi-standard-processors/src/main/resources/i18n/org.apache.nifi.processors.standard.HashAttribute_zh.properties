__CapabilityDescription=Hashes together the key/value pairs of several FlowFile Attributes and adds the hash as a new attribute. Optional properties are to be added such that the name of the property is the name of a FlowFile Attribute to consider and the value of the property is a regular expression that, if matched by the attribute value, will cause that attribute to be used as part of the hash. If the regular expression contains a capturing group, only the value of the capturing group will be used.
__Tags=attributes, hash
Hash_Value_Attribute_Key.displayName=Hash Value Attribute Key
Hash_Value_Attribute_Key.description=The name of the FlowFile Attribute where the hash value should be stored
A_flowfile_attribute_key_for_attribute_inspection.description=This regular expression is evaluated against the flowfile attribute values. If the regular expression contains a capturing group, the value of that group will be used when comparing flow file attributes. Otherwise, the original flow file attribute's value will be used if and only if the value matches the given regular expression.
__Relationship.success.description=Used for FlowFiles that have a hash value added
__Relationship.failure.description=Used for FlowFiles that are missing required attributes
__WritesAttribute.Hash_Value_Attribute_Key.description=This Processor adds an attribute whose value is the result of Hashing the existing FlowFile attributes. The name of this attribute is specified by the <Hash Value Attribute Key> property.
