__CapabilityDescription=Listens for RELP messages being sent to a given port over TCP. Each message will be acknowledged after successfully writing the message to a FlowFile. Each FlowFile will contain data portion of one or more RELP frames. In the case where the RELP frames contain syslog messages, the output of this processor can be sent to a ParseSyslog processor for further processing.
__Tags=listen, relp, tcp, logs
Local_Network_Interface.displayName=Local Network Interface
Local_Network_Interface.description=The name of a local network interface to be used to restrict listening to a specific LAN.
Port.displayName=Port
Port.description=The port to listen on for communication.
Receive_Buffer_Size.displayName=Receive Buffer Size
Receive_Buffer_Size.description=The size of each buffer used to receive messages. Adjust this value appropriately based on the expected size of the incoming messages.
Max_Size_of_Message_Queue.displayName=Max Size of Message Queue
Max_Size_of_Message_Queue.description=The maximum size of the internal queue used to buffer messages being transferred from the underlying channel to the processor. Setting this value higher allows more messages to be buffered in memory during surges of incoming messages, but increases the total memory used by the processor.
Max_Size_of_Socket_Buffer.displayName=Max Size of Socket Buffer
Max_Size_of_Socket_Buffer.description=The maximum size of the socket buffer that should be used. This is a suggestion to the Operating System to indicate how big the socket buffer should be. If this value is set too low, the buffer may fill up before the data can be read, and incoming data will be dropped.
Character_Set.displayName=Character Set
Character_Set.description=Specifies the character set of the received data.
Max_Batch_Size.displayName=Max Batch Size
Max_Batch_Size.description=The maximum number of messages to add to a single FlowFile. If multiple messages are available, they will be concatenated along with the <Message Delimiter> up to this configured maximum number of messages
Message_Delimiter.displayName=Batching Message Delimiter
Message_Delimiter.description=Specifies the delimiter to place between messages when multiple messages are bundled together (see <Max Batch Size> property).
Max_Number_of_TCP_Connections.displayName=Max Number of TCP Connections
Max_Number_of_TCP_Connections.description=The maximum number of concurrent TCP connections to accept.

__Relationship.success.description=Messages received successfully will be sent out this relationship.
__WritesAttribute.relp.command.description=The command of the RELP frames.
__WritesAttribute.relp.sender.description=The sending host of the messages.
__WritesAttribute.relp.port.description=The sending port the messages were received over.
__WritesAttribute.relp.txnr.description=The transaction number of the message. Only included if <Batch Size> is 1.
__WritesAttribute.mime.type.description=The mime.type of the content which is text/plain
