Monitoring_Scope.description=Specify how to determine activeness of the flow. 'node' means that activeness is examined at individual node separately. It can be useful if DFM expects each node should receive flow files in a distributed manner. With 'cluster', it defines the flow is active while at least one node receives flow files actively. If current platform is running as standalone mode, this should be set as 'node', if it's 'cluster', platform logs a warning message and act as 'node' scope.
Reporting_Node.description=Specify which node should send notification flow-files to inactive and activity.restored relationships. With 'all', every node in this cluster send notification flow-files. 'primary' means flow-files will be sent only from a primary node. If current platform is running as standalone mode, this should be set as 'all', even if it's 'primary', platform act as 'all'.
