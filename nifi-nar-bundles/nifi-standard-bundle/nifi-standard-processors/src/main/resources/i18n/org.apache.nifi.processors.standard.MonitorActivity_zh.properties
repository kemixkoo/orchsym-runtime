__CapabilityDescription=Monitors the flow for activity and sends out an indicator when the flow has not had any data for some specified amount of time and again when the flow's activity is restored
__Tags=monitor, flow, active, inactive, activity, detection
Threshold_Duration.displayName=Threshold Duration
Threshold_Duration.description=Determines how much time must elapse before considering the flow to be inactive
Continually_Send_Messages.displayName=Continually Send Messages
Continually_Send_Messages.description=If true, will send inactivity indicator continually every Threshold Duration amount of time until activity is restored; if false, will send an indicator only when the flow first becomes inactive
__AllowableValue.Continually_Send_Messages.false.displayName=\u5426
__AllowableValue.Continually_Send_Messages.true.displayName=\u662f
Inactivity_Message.displayName=Inactivity Message
Inactivity_Message.description=The message that will be the content of FlowFiles that are sent to the 'inactive' relationship
Activity_Restored_Message.displayName=Activity Restored Message
Activity_Restored_Message.description=The message that will be the content of FlowFiles that are sent to 'activity.restored' relationship
Copy_Attributes.displayName=Copy Attributes
Copy_Attributes.description=If true, will copy all flow file attributes from the flow file that resumed activity to the newly created indicator flow file
__AllowableValue.Copy_Attributes.false.displayName=\u4e0d\u62f7\u8d1d
__AllowableValue.Copy_Attributes.true.displayName=\u62f7\u8d1d
Monitoring_Scope.displayName=Monitoring Scope
Monitoring_Scope.description=Specify how to determine activeness of the flow. 'node' means that activeness is examined at individual node separately. It can be useful if DFM expects each node should receive flow files in a distributed manner. With 'cluster', it defines the flow is active while at least one node receives flow files actively. If NiFi is running as standalone mode, this should be set as 'node', if it's 'cluster', NiFi logs a warning message and act as 'node' scope.
__AllowableValue.Monitoring_Scope.cluster.displayName=cluster
__AllowableValue.Monitoring_Scope.node.displayName=node
Reporting_Node.displayName=Reporting Node
Reporting_Node.description=Specify which node should send notification flow-files to inactive and activity.restored relationships. With 'all', every node in this cluster send notification flow-files. 'primary' means flow-files will be sent only from a primary node. If NiFi is running as standalone mode, this should be set as 'all', even if it's 'primary', NiFi act as 'all'.
__AllowableValue.Reporting_Node.all.displayName=all
__AllowableValue.Reporting_Node.primary.displayName=primary
__Relationship.inactive.description=This relationship is used to transfer an Inactivity indicator when no FlowFiles are routed to 'success' for Threshold Duration amount of time
__Relationship.success.description=All incoming FlowFiles are routed to success
__Relationship.activity.restored.description=This relationship is used to transfer an Activity Restored indicator when FlowFiles are routing to 'success' following a period of inactivity
__WritesAttribute.inactivityStartMillis.description=The time at which Inactivity began, in the form of milliseconds since Epoch
__WritesAttribute.inactivityDurationMillis.description=The number of milliseconds that the inactivity has spanned
__Stateful.description=MonitorActivity stores the last timestamp at each node as state, so that it can examine activity at cluster wide.If 'Copy Attribute' is set to true, then flow file attributes are also persisted.
