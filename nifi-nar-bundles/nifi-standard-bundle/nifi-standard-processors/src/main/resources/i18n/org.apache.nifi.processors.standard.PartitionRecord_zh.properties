__CapabilityDescription=Receives Record-oriented data (i.e., data that can be read by the configured Record Reader) and evaluates one or more RecordPaths against the each record in the incoming FlowFile. Each record is then grouped with other "like records" and a FlowFile is created for each group of "like records." What it means for two records to be "like records" is determined by user-defined properties. The user is required to enter at least one user-defined property whose value is a RecordPath. Two records are considered alike if they have the same value for all configured RecordPaths. Because we know that all records in a given output FlowFile have the same value for the fields that are specified by the RecordPath, an attribute is added for each field. See Additional Details on the Usage page for more information and examples.

record-reader.displayName=Record Reader
record-reader.description=Specifies the Controller Service to use for reading incoming data
record-writer.displayName=Record Writer
record-writer.description=Specifies the Controller Service to use for writing out the records
The_name_given_to_the_dynamic_property_is_the_name_of_the_attribute_that_will_be_used_to_denote_the_value_of_the_associted_RecordPath..description=Each dynamic property represents a RecordPath that will be evaluated against each record in an incoming FlowFile. When the value of the RecordPath is determined for a Record, an attribute is added to the outgoing FlowFile. The name of the attribute is the same as the name of this property. The value of the attribute is the same as the value of the field in the Record that the RecordPath points to. Note that no attribute will be added if the value returned for the RecordPath is null or is not a scalar value (i.e., the value is an Array, Map, or Record).
__Relationship.success.description=FlowFiles that are successfully partitioned will be routed to this relationship
__Relationship.failure.description=If a FlowFile cannot be partitioned from the configured input format to the configured output format, the unchanged FlowFile will be routed to this relationship
__Relationship.original.description=Once all records in an incoming FlowFile have been partitioned, the original FlowFile is routed to this relationship.
__WritesAttribute.record.count.description=The number of records in an outgoing FlowFile
__WritesAttribute.mime.type.description=The MIME Type that the configured Record Writer indicates is appropriate
__WritesAttribute.<dynamic_property_name>.description=For each dynamic property that is added, an attribute may be added to the FlowFile. See the description for Dynamic Properties for more information.
