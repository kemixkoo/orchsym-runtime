__CapabilityDescription=Segments a FlowFile into multiple smaller segments on byte boundaries. Each segment is given the following attributes\: fragment.identifier, fragment.index, fragment.count, segment.original.filename; these attributes can then be used by the MergeContent processor in order to reconstitute the original FlowFile
__Tags=segment, split
Segment_Size.displayName=Segment Size
Segment_Size.description=The maximum data size in bytes for each segment
__Relationship.segments.description=All segments will be sent to this relationship. If the file was small enough that it was not segmented, a copy of the original is sent to this relationship as well as original
__Relationship.original.description=The original FlowFile will be sent to this relationship
__WritesAttribute.segment.identifier.description=All segments produced from the same parent FlowFile will have the same randomly generated UUID added for this attribute. This attribute is added to maintain backward compatibility, but the fragment.identifier is preferred, as it is designed to work in conjunction with the MergeContent Processor
__WritesAttribute.segment.index.description=A one-up number that indicates the ordering of the segments that were created from a single parent FlowFile. This attribute is added to maintain backward compatibility, but the fragment.index is preferred, as it is designed to work in conjunction with the MergeContent Processor
__WritesAttribute.segment.count.description=The number of segments generated from the parent FlowFile. This attribute is added to maintain backward compatibility, but the fragment.count is preferred, as it is designed to work in conjunction with the MergeContent Processor
__WritesAttribute.fragment.identifier.description=All segments produced from the same parent FlowFile will have the same randomly generated UUID added for this attribute
__WritesAttribute.fragment.index.description=A one-up number that indicates the ordering of the segments that were created from a single parent FlowFile
__WritesAttribute.fragment.count.description=The number of segments generated from the parent FlowFile
__WritesAttribute.segment.original.filename_.description=The filename will be updated to include the parent's filename, the segment index, and the segment count
