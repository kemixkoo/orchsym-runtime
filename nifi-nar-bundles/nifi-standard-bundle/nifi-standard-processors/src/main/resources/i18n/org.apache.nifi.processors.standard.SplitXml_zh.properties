__CapabilityDescription=Splits an XML File into multiple separate FlowFiles, each comprising a child or descendant of the original root element
__Tags=xml, split
Split_Depth.displayName=Split Depth
Split_Depth.description=Indicates the XML-nesting depth to start splitting XML fragments. A depth of 1 means split the root's children, whereas a depth of 2 means split the root's children's children and so forth.
__Relationship.failure.description=If a FlowFile fails processing for any reason (for example, the FlowFile is not valid XML), it will be routed to this relationship
__Relationship.original.description=The original FlowFile that was split into segments. If the FlowFile fails processing, nothing will be sent to this relationship
__Relationship.split.description=All segments of the original FlowFile will be routed to this relationship
__WritesAttribute.fragment.identifier.description=All split FlowFiles produced from the same parent FlowFile will have the same randomly generated UUID added for this attribute
__WritesAttribute.fragment.index.description=A one-up number that indicates the ordering of the split FlowFiles that were created from a single parent FlowFile
__WritesAttribute.fragment.count.description=The number of split FlowFiles generated from the parent FlowFile
__WritesAttribute.segment.original.filename_.description=The filename of the parent FlowFile
__SystemResource.MEMORY.description=The entirety of the FlowFile's content (as a Document object) is read into memory, in addition to all of the generated FlowFiles representing the split XML. A Document object can take approximately 10 times as much memory as the size of the XML. For example, a 1 MB XML document may use 10 MB of memory. If many splits are generated due to the size of the XML, a two-phase approach may be necessary to avoid excessive use of memory.
