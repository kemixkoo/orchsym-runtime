__CapabilityDescription=Unpacks the content of FlowFiles that have been packaged with one of several different Packaging Formats, emitting one to many FlowFiles for each input FlowFile
__Tags=Unpack, un-merge, tar, zip, archive, flowfile-stream, flowfile-stream-v3
Packaging_Format.displayName=Packaging Format
Packaging_Format.description=The Packaging Format used to create the file
__AllowableValue.Packaging_Format.use_mime.type_attribute.displayName=use mime.type attribute
__AllowableValue.Packaging_Format.tar.displayName=tar
__AllowableValue.Packaging_Format.zip.displayName=zip
__AllowableValue.Packaging_Format.flowfile-stream-v3.displayName=flowfile-stream-v3
__AllowableValue.Packaging_Format.flowfile-stream-v2.displayName=flowfile-stream-v2
__AllowableValue.Packaging_Format.flowfile-tar-v1.displayName=flowfile-tar-v1
File_Filter.displayName=File Filter
File_Filter.description=Only files contained in the archive whose names match the given regular expression will be extracted (tar/zip only)
__Relationship.success.description=Unpacked FlowFiles are sent to this relationship
__Relationship.failure.description=The original FlowFile is sent to this relationship when it cannot be unpacked for some reason
__Relationship.original.description=The original FlowFile is sent to this relationship after it has been successfully unpacked
__ReadsAttribute.mime.type.description=If the <Packaging Format> property is set to use mime.type attribute, this attribute is used to determine the FlowFile's MIME Type. In this case, if the attribute is set to application/tar, the TAR Packaging Format will be used. If the attribute is set to application/zip, the ZIP Packaging Format will be used. If the attribute is set to application/flowfile-v3 or application/flowfile-v2 or application/flowfile-v1, the appropriate FlowFile Packaging Format will be used. If this attribute is missing, the FlowFile will be routed to 'failure'. Otherwise, if the attribute's value is not one of those mentioned above, the FlowFile will be routed to 'success' without being unpacked. Use the File Filter property only extract files matching a specific regular expression.
__WritesAttribute.mime.type.description=If the FlowFile is successfully unpacked, its MIME Type is no longer known, so the mime.type attribute is set to application/octet-stream.
__WritesAttribute.fragment.identifier.description=All unpacked FlowFiles produced from the same parent FlowFile will have the same randomly generated UUID added for this attribute
__WritesAttribute.fragment.index.description=A one-up number that indicates the ordering of the unpacked FlowFiles that were created from a single parent FlowFile
__WritesAttribute.fragment.count.description=The number of unpacked FlowFiles generated from the parent FlowFile
__WritesAttribute.segment.original.filename_.description=The filename of the parent FlowFile. Extensions of .tar, .zip or .pkg are removed because the MergeContent processor automatically adds those extensions if it is used to rebuild the original FlowFile
