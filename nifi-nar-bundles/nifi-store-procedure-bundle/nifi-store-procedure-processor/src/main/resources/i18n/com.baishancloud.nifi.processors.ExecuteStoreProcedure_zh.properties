__CapabilityDescription=call provided SQL store procedure method. Query result will be converted to JSON. Streaming is used so arbitrarily large result sets are supported. This processor can be scheduled to run on a timer, or cron expression, using the standard scheduling methods, or it can be triggered by an incoming FlowFile. If it is triggered by an incoming FlowFile, then attributes of that FlowFile will be available when evaluating the select query, and the query may use the ? to escape parameters. In this case, the parameters to use must exist as FlowFile attributes with the naming convention sql.args.N.type and sql.args.N.value, where N is a positive integer. The sql.args.N.type is expected to be a number indicating the JDBC Type. The content of the FlowFile is expected to be in UTF-8 format. FlowFile attribute 'executesql.row.count' indicates how many rows were selected.

Database_Connection_Pooling_Service.displayName=Database Connection Pooling Service
Database_Connection_Pooling_Service.description=The Controller Service that is used to obtain connection to database
MethodName.displayName=MethodName
MethodName.description=The method name to call. If this property is specified, it will be used regardless of the content of incoming flowfiles. If this property is empty, the content of the incoming flow file is expected to a valid method, to be issued by the processor to the database.
Max_Wait_Time.displayName=Max Wait Time
Max_Wait_Time.description=The maximum amount of time allowed for a running SQL select query  , zero means there is no limit. Max time less than 1 second will be equal to zero.
Params.displayName=Params
Params.description=The params to method. If this property is specified, it will be used regardless of the attr of incoming flowfiles. If this property is empty, the attr of the incoming flow file is expected to be valid, to be issued by the processor to the database.params is JsonArray which has many JsonObjectsrepresents to a param features ,features key contails param.index,param.value,param.type,param.value.type,param.format. the value of param.index is a Integer represents a param sequence in a sql. param.type is a param typelike IN,IN/OUT,OUT. param. param. param.value and param.value.type respresents the value and value type of the param.param.format is optional, but default options may not always work for your data. "\nIncoming FlowFiles are expected to be parametrized SQL statements. In some cases "\na format option needs to be specified, currently this is only applicable for binary data types, dates, times and timestamps. Binary Data Types (defaults to 'ascii') - "\nascii\: each string character in your attribute value represents a single byte. This is the format provided by Avro Processors. "\nbase64\: the string is a Base64 encoded string that can be decoded to bytes. "\nhex\: the string is hex encoded with all letters in upper case and no '0x' at the beginning. "\nDates/Times/Timestamps - "\nDate, Time and Timestamp formats all support both custom formats or named format ('yyyy-MM-dd','ISO_OFFSET_DATE_TIME') "\nas specified according to java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter. "\nIf not specified, a long value input is expected to be an unix epoch (milli seconds from 1970/1/1), or a string value in "\n'yyyy-MM-dd' format for Date, 'HH\:mm\:ss.SSS' for Time (some database engines e.g. Derby or MySQL do not support milliseconds and will truncate milliseconds), "\n'yyyy-MM-dd HH\:mm\:ss.SSS' for Timestamp is used.

Fetch_Size.description=The maximum amount of time allowed for a running SQL select query  , zero means there is no limit. Max time less than 1 second will be equal to zero.
__Relationship.success.description=Successfully created FlowFile from SQL query result set.
__Relationship.failure.description=SQL query execution failed. Incoming FlowFile will be penalized and routed to this relationship
__WritesAttribute.executesql.row.count.description=Contains the number of rows returned in the select query
__WritesAttribute.executesql.query.duration.description=Duration of the query in milliseconds
__WritesAttribute.executesql.resultset.index.description=Assuming multiple result sets are returned, the zero based index of this result set.
