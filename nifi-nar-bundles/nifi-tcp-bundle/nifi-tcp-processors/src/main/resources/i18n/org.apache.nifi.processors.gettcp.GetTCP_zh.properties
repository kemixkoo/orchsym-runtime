__Tags=get, fetch, poll, tcp, ingest, source, input
endpoint-list.displayName=Endpoint List
endpoint-list.description=A comma delimited list of the endpoints to connect to. The format should be <server_address>\:<port>. Only one server will be connected to at a time, the others will be used as fail overs.
connection-attempt-timeout.displayName=Connection Attempt Count
connection-attempt-timeout.description=The number of times to try and establish a connection, before using a backup host if available. This same attempt count would be used for a backup host as well.
reconnect-interval.displayName=Reconnect interval
reconnect-interval.description=The number of seconds to wait before attempting to reconnect to the endpoint.
receive-buffer-size.displayName=Receive Buffer Size
receive-buffer-size.description=The size of the buffer to receive data in. Default 16384 (16MB).
end-of-message-byte.displayName=End of message delimiter byte
end-of-message-byte.description=Byte value which denotes end of message. Must be specified as integer within the valid byte range (-128 thru 127). For example, '13' \= Carriage return and '10' \= New line. Default '13'.
__Relationship.Partial.description=The relationship that all incomplete messages from the endpoint will be sent to. Incomplete message is the message that doesn't end with 'End of message delimiter byte'. This can happen when 'Receive Buffer Size' is smaller then the incoming message. If that happens that the subsequent message that completes the previous incomplete message will also end up in this relationship, after which subsequent 'complete' messages will go to 'success'.
__Relationship.Success.description=The relationship that all sucessful messages from the endpoint will be sent to.
__WritesAttribute.source.endpoint.description=The address of the source endpoint the message came from
